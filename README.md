# Machine-Learning-JS

This is a playground for Machine Learning.
It visualises a simple example in which the user is prompted to enrich the training set of a Decision Tree algorithm.

A demo (in Greek) can be found [here](https://scify.github.io/Machine-Learning-JS-playground/).

This project uses the [decision-tree-js](https://github.com/lagodiuk/decision-tree-js) library.
